# Iterative Sparse Solvers

This sample illustrates the use of iterative sparse solvers and preconditioners for efficiently solving large, sparse systems of linear equations using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve large sparse systems of linear equations using iterative 
solvers and preconditioners in Numerics.NET.

The sample shows two main examples:

1. Solving a non-symmetric sparse system loaded from Matrix Market files using the BiConjugate Gradient 
solver. It demonstrates how to:
   - Load sparse matrices from files
   - Create and configure an iterative solver
   - Apply preconditioners to improve convergence
   - Monitor solution progress and error estimates

2. Solving the Laplace equation on a rectangular grid using a symmetric solver. This example shows how to:
   - Construct a sparse matrix representing the discretized Laplace operator
   - Set up boundary conditions
   - Solve the resulting system using the Quasi-Minimal Residual method
   - Handle symmetric vs non-symmetric systems appropriately

The sample illustrates proper error handling, solver selection based on matrix properties, and the 
benefits of preconditioning for convergence acceleration. It provides a practical introduction to solving
large-scale sparse linear systems efficiently.
