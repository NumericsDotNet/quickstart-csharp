# Accessing Matrix Elements

This sample illustrates different ways of iterating through the rows and columns of a matrix using classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates the various ways to access and manipulate elements, rows, columns, and 
submatrices in Numerics.NET matrices.

The sample shows how to:
- Access individual matrix elements using index notation
- Extract complete or partial rows and columns using range syntax
- Use the `GetRow` and `GetColumn` methods for accessing matrix components
- Enumerate through matrix rows and columns 
- Access matrix diagonals and superdiagonals
- Work with submatrices through both indexing and dedicated methods
- Assign values to matrix components, including rows, columns and submatrices

The sample provides practical examples of each operation, demonstrating both read and write 
operations on matrices. It illustrates the flexibility of Numerics.NET's matrix access methods,
from simple element access to sophisticated operations on matrix substructures.
