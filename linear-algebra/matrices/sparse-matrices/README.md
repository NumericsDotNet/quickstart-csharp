# Sparse Matrices

This sample illustrates using sparse vectors and matrices using the classes in the Numerics.NET.LinearAlgebra.Sparse namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with sparse vectors and matrices in Numerics.NET using the classes in 
the LinearAlgebra.Sparse namespace.

Sparse vectors and matrices are data structures optimized for situations where most elements are zero. 
Instead of storing all elements, they only store the non-zero values and their positions. This makes them 
memory efficient for large but sparse data.

The sample shows:
- Different ways to create sparse vectors and matrices
- How to specify initial capacity and fill factors
- Methods to insert individual elements and groups of elements
- Accessing elements and iterating over non-zero entries
- Working with rows, columns and submatrices (cliques)
- Mathematical operations optimized for sparse structures
- Performance considerations when working with large sparse matrices

The code includes examples of both successful operations and potential pitfalls, such as operations that 
may revert to dense algorithms and fail on very large matrices.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- Required NuGet packages: Numerics.NET.Core, Version 9.1.0

### Running the Sample

#### In Visual Studio
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio
2. Restore NuGet packages: Right-click on the solution → Restore NuGet Packages
3. Update the trial key in the code:
4. Press F5 to build and run the sample

#### In VS Code

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Make sure you have the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) installed
3. Open a terminal and run: `dotnet restore`
4. Update the trial key in the code 
5. Run the sample with: `dotnet run`

#### From the Command Line

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
2. Run `dotnet restore` to restore the required NuGet packages
3. Update the trial key in the code
4. Run the sample with `dotnet run`

### Getting a Trial Key
