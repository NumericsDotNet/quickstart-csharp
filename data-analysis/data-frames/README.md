# Data Frames

This sample illustrates how to create and manipulate data frames using classes in the Numerics.NET.DataAnalysis namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to work with data frames in Numerics.NET, showing various ways to create,
manipulate and transform tabular data structures similar to R's data frames or Python's pandas DataFrames.

The sample illustrates multiple approaches for creating data frames including:
- Creating from dictionaries of columns
- Creating from tuples
- Creating from sequences of objects
- Importing from various data sources (CSV files, databases)
- Converting from vectors and matrices

It also shows how to work with indexes, including:
- Using default numeric indexes
- Creating custom row indexes
- Using date-based indexes
- Creating hierarchical multi-level indexes
- Modifying both row and column indexes

The example demonstrates practical data frame operations using both synthetic data and real-world
datasets like iris and titanic, making it a comprehensive introduction to data frame functionality
in Numerics.NET.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
