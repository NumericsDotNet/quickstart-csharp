# Two-Way Anova

This sample illustrates how to use the TwoWayAnovaModel class to perform a two-way analysis of variance using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the TwoWayAnovaModel 
class in Numerics.NET.

The example analyzes a marketing study investigating how package color and shape affect product sales. 
The data comes from 12 stores where packages varied in:
- Color (blue, red, or green)
- Shape (square or rectangular)

The sample shows how to:
- Create a data frame from anonymous records containing the experimental data
- Construct and fit a two-way ANOVA model using both direct parameters and formula syntax
- Check if the design is balanced
- Display the ANOVA table with significance tests
- Access cell-level statistics like means and variances for specific factor combinations
- Calculate marginal means using row and column totals
- Obtain overall summary statistics for the complete dataset

The code demonstrates key TwoWayAnovaModel features including factor access, cell statistics, and 
data summarization capabilities for analyzing multifactor experimental designs.
