# Repeated Measures Anova

This sample illustrates how to use the OneWayRAnovaModel class to perform a one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures using 
the OneWayRAnovaModel class from Numerics.NET.

The sample analyzes a study investigating the effects of four different drugs on test scores across five 
subjects. Each subject is tested with all four drugs, making this a repeated measures design. The code 
shows how to:

- Create a DataFrame from sample data containing subject IDs, drug treatments, and test scores
- Set up and fit a one-way repeated measures ANOVA model using both direct specification and formula syntax
- Check if the experimental design is balanced
- Display the ANOVA results table showing sources of variation, degrees of freedom, and significance
- Access and analyze group means and variance for different treatment levels
- Extract overall summary statistics like the grand mean and total number of observations

The example illustrates key concepts in repeated measures ANOVA including:
- Working with within-subjects factors
- Handling repeated observations on the same subjects
- Analyzing treatment effects while accounting for individual differences
- Interpreting ANOVA results for repeated measures designs
