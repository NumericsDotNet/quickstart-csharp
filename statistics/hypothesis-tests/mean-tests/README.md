# Mean Tests

This sample illustrates how to use various tests for the mean of one or more sanples using classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Tests namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform statistical hypothesis testing on sample means using the 
Numerics.NET.Statistics.Tests namespace.

The sample works with a scenario involving test scores from two groups of students compared against a
national average. It shows three different approaches to testing means:

1. One-sample z-test: Used when comparing a sample mean to a known population mean and standard
   deviation. The sample demonstrates how to:
   - Create a test using sample data and population parameters
   - Calculate and interpret test statistics and p-values
   - Work with different significance levels
   - Generate confidence intervals

2. One-sample t-test: Used when comparing a sample mean to a population mean when the population
   standard deviation is unknown. The example shows:
   - How to construct and execute the test
   - Interpreting test results
   - Generating confidence intervals

3. Two-sample t-test: Used for comparing means between two independent samples. The sample shows:
   - How to set up the test with two sample groups
   - Interpreting the results to determine if the groups differ significantly

Throughout the sample, you'll learn how to:
- Work with numerical data using Vector objects
- Calculate basic statistics like means and standard deviations
- Set up and run different types of hypothesis tests
- Interpret test results using p-values and confidence intervals
- Make statistical decisions using different significance levels
