# Simple Regression

This sample illustrates how to perform a simple linear regression using the SimpleRegressionModel class using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression analysis using the 
SimpleRegressionModel class in Numerics.NET.

The sample shows two different regression scenarios using data from the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology's Statistical Reference Datasets (NIST StRD). The first example demonstrates
a no-intercept model using the 'NoInt1' dataset, while the second uses the 'Norris' dataset with
an intercept term.

For each model, the sample shows how to:
- Create and populate the dependent and independent variable data
- Construct and configure the SimpleRegressionModel
- Fit the model to the data
- Access key regression statistics including:
  - Parameter estimates and standard errors
  - Residual standard error
  - R-squared and adjusted R-squared values
  - F-statistic
  - ANOVA table results

The code illustrates different ways to input data, including using simple arrays and Vector objects.
It also demonstrates how to control model properties like the intercept term.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
