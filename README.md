## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **.NET 8.0 SDK or later** (required for this `net8.0` sample branch).
* An IDE such as Visual Studio, VS Code, XCode, Cursor...
* Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS for development.

*Note: Numerics.NET as a library supports a wider range of .NET versions, 
including .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0, .NET 6.0, and up to the latest 
.NET releases (e.g., .NET 10.0 Preview).*

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone this Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NumericsDotNet/quickstart-csharp.git
    cd quickstart-csharp
    ```
    Ensure you are on the correct branch for your desired .NET version 
    (this README is for the `net8.0` targeted branch).

2.  **Open the Solution:** Launch the `quickStart-csharp.sln` solution file 
    in your preferred .NET IDE.

3.  **Obtain a Trial Key:**
    * Visit the [Numerics.NET website](https://numerics.net/trial-key) to request a 30-day trial key.
    * Sign in using your preferred provider to receive your key.

4.  **Activate the Trial:**
    Within each sample project, locate a line similar to:
    ```csharp
    Numerics.NET.License.Verify("your-trial-key-here");
    ```
    Replace `"your-trial-key-here"` with the actual trial key you received.

5.  **Run the Samples:**
    * Execute samples directly from your IDE (right-click on a project and choose "Run" or "Debug").
    * Or, use the command line from the root `quickstart-csharp` directory:
        ```bash
        dotnet run --project <sample_project_folder_name>
        ```
        For example:
        ```bash
        dotnet run --project data-analysis/data-wrangling
        ```
        (Adjust the project path as needed based on the sample you wish to run.)


## Repository Structure

The samples are organized into folders by category. Each sample resides in its own dedicated project folder. Data files used by the samples are located in the top-level `data` directory.

```

This repository has multiple branches corresponding to different .NET versions. 
Some features may only be available in newer .NET versions. 
The current branch targets **net8.0** and higher.

## Sample Overview

This repository provides practical examples for various Numerics.NET features, including:

- **Mathematics**: Calculus (differentiation, integration), numerical analysis, special functions, complex numbers, and more.
- **Linear Algebra**: Operations on vectors and matrices (dense and sparse), solving linear systems, matrix decompositions (LU, QR, SVD, Eigenvalue), and tensor operations.
- **Statistics**: Descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and other statistical models.
- **Data Analysis**: Tools for data import (e.g., CSV), data frames for data manipulation, cleaning, transformation, and analysis including pivoting and grouping.

## Quick Example

Here’s a brief illustration of Numerics.NET's concise syntax for common tasks:

```csharp
// Create a matrix and a vector and perform operations
Matrix<double> A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];
Vector<double> b = [5, 6];
var x = A.Solve(b); // Solve Ax = b
var eigenValues = A.GetEigenValues();
var (U, S, V) = A.GetSingularValueDecomposition();

// Find the minimum of the famous Rosenbrock function:
var minimum = SymbolicMath.FindMinimum(
    (x, y) => (1.0 - x) * (1.0 - x) + 100 * Elementary.Pow(y - x * x, 2), 
    initialGuess: [-1, 1]);
Console.WriteLine(minimum);

// Find out the survival rate for the Titanic disaster by class:
var titanic = DelimitedTextFile.ReadDataFrame(@"titanic.csv");
var survived = titanic["Survived"].As<bool>();
var pclass = titanic["Pclass"].AsCategorical();
var survivedByClass = new Pivot(pclass, survived.AsCategorical())
    .CountsMatrix().WithColumnIndex(["Died", "Survived"])
    .NormalizeRowsInPlace(VectorNorm.OneNorm);
Console.WriteLine(survivedByClass.Summarize());
```
