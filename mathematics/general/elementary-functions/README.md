# Elementary Functions

This sample illustrates how to use additional elementary functions using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates the use of specialized elementary mathematical functions provided by 
Numerics.NET that offer higher precision and better numerical stability than standard methods.

The sample shows how to use functions that handle edge cases and potential numerical issues that can 
arise when working with floating-point arithmetic. It specifically covers:

- Using `Log1PlusX` for accurately computing log(1+x) when x is close to zero
- Using `ExpMinus1` for precise calculation of exp(x)-1 near zero
- Computing hypotenuse values for very large numbers without overflow using `Hypot`
- Efficient integer power calculations using specialized `Pow` methods

These functions are particularly important in scientific computing and numerical analysis where 
maintaining precision and avoiding numerical instability is crucial. The sample includes comparisons 
between standard .NET Math methods and their numerically stable Numerics.NET counterparts.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
