# FFT/Fourier Transforms

This sample illustrates how to compute the forward and inverse Fourier transform of a real or complex signal using classes in the Numerics.NET.SignalProcessing namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to compute Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) using Numerics.NET's signal
processing capabilities.

The sample shows several approaches to computing Fourier transforms:

- Using static methods for one-time FFT computations on both real and complex vectors
- Creating reusable FFT objects for efficient repeated transforms of the same size
- Working with one-sided FFTs for real signals
- Computing 2D Fourier transforms on matrices

The code illustrates important concepts including:
- Handling complex conjugate symmetry in real signal transforms
- Setting scale factors for forward and inverse transforms
- Using different FFT formats and overloads
- Proper resource management with disposable FFT objects
- Working with both one-dimensional and two-dimensional transforms

The sample includes examples with both synthetic test data and more realistic signal processing
scenarios, making it a practical introduction to FFT computations in Numerics.NET.
