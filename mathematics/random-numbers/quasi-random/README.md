# Quasi-Random Sequences

This sample illustrates how to generate quasi-random sequences like Fauré and Sobol sequences using classes in the Numerics.NET.Statistics.Random namespace using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use quasi-random sequences to compute multi-dimensional integrals 
efficiently and accurately.

The sample shows how to use both Halton and Sobol sequences to evaluate a specific 5-dimensional
integral. It demonstrates the key differences between these sequence types and provides practical
examples of their usage. The program:

- Creates a Halton sequence and uses it to estimate a 5-dimensional integral
- Shows how to iterate through the sequence points and evaluate the integrand
- Demonstrates progress monitoring by displaying intermediate results
- Illustrates the use of the more sophisticated Sobol sequences
- Shows how to skip points in a Sobol sequence efficiently
- Compares the results to the known exact value of the integral

The sample serves as a practical introduction to quasi-random number generation and shows how these
sequences can be more effective than pseudo-random numbers for certain numerical integration tasks.
It includes examples of proper sequence initialization and demonstrates recommended usage patterns
for both sequence types.
