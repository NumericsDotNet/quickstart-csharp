# Nonlinear Systems

This sample illustrates the use of the NewtonRaphsonSystemSolver and DoglegSystemSolver classes for solving systems of nonlinear equations using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to solve systems of nonlinear equations using Numerics.NET's equation 
solver classes.

The sample illustrates solving a system of two nonlinear equations using both the Newton-Raphson method
and Powell's dogleg method. It shows:

- How to define systems of equations using delegates
- How to provide derivatives (the Jacobian matrix) for better performance
- How to use automatic differentiation when derivatives are not available
- How to control convergence criteria and iteration limits
- How to interpret solver status and results
- How to use Powell's dogleg method for more robust convergence
- How to solve systems without providing derivatives

The sample includes extensive comments explaining each step and demonstrates various solver options
and parameters that control the solution process. It shows how to handle both simple cases and more
complex scenarios where additional control over the solution process is needed.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET 6.0 or .NET 8.0)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

### Running the Sample

#### In Visual Studio
1. Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio
2. Restore NuGet packages: Right-click on the solution → Restore NuGet Packages
3. Update the trial key in the code:
4. Press F5 to build and run the sample

#### In VS Code

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Make sure you have the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) installed
3. Open a terminal and run: `dotnet restore`
4. Update the trial key in the code 
5. Run the sample with: `dotnet run`

#### From the Command Line

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
