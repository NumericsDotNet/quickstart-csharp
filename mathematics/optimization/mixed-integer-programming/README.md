# Mixed Integer Programming

This sample illustrates how to solve mixed integer programming by solving Sudoku puzzles using the linear programming solver using Numerics.NET.

## Overview

This QuickStart sample demonstrates how to use mixed integer programming capabilities to solve complex constraint 
satisfaction problems, using a Sudoku puzzle as an engaging example.

The sample shows how to formulate the Sudoku puzzle as a mixed integer programming problem by:
- Creating binary variables to represent possible digit placements
- Expressing Sudoku rules as linear constraints
- Setting up constraints for each position, row, column, and 3x3 block
- Using bound constraints to fix known values
- Solving the system to find a valid solution

The code specifically tackles the puzzle known as "the world's hardest Sudoku" to demonstrate the 
power of the approach. It showcases key features of the LinearProgram class including:
- Adding binary variables
- Creating linear constraints
- Setting variable bounds
- Solving mixed integer programs

This example illustrates how mathematical programming can be used to solve constraint satisfaction
problems that might be difficult to solve using traditional algorithmic approaches.
